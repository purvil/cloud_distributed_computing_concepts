    "### 6 Constraints of REST\n",
    "1. Client-server architecture\n",
    "    - Client manages UI concerns and server manages data storage concerns. One REST server is handling multiple client without knowing what they look like or what they are doing.\n",
    "    - Separation of content and its presentation\n",
    "2. Statelessness\n",
    "    - No client context or info can be saved on the server between the request.\n",
    "3. Cacheability\n",
    "    - All REST response must be marked as cacheable or not cacheable.\n",
    "4. Layered System\n",
    "    - Client can not know or should not care whether it is connected directly to the server or to an intermediary.\n",
    "5. Code on demand\n",
    "    - Server are allowed to transfer executable code like JS and compiled components to clients.\n",
    "6. Uniform Interface\n",
    "    - Resource id in request: URI request must specify what resource it is looking for and what format the response should be.\n",
    "    - Resource manipulation through representations: Once client has representation of resource, it can modify or delete the resource.\n",
    "    - Self descriptive message: Each representation must describe its own data format\n",
    "    - Hypermedia as the engine of application: Once client has access to REST service, it should be able to discover all available resource and methods through the hyperlink provided"
