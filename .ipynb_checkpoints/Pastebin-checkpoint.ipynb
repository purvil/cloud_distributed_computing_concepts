One possible problem here could be that the insertion fails because of a duplicate key.

KGS can use two tables to store keys, one for keys that are not used yet and one for all the used keys. As soon as KGS gives some keys to an application server, it can move these to the used keys table. KGS can always keep some keys in memory so that whenever a server needs them, it can quickly provide them. As soon as KGS loads some keys in memory, it can move them to the used keys table, this way we can make sure each server gets unique keys.
